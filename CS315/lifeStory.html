    <h1>My life story</h1>
    <p> My name is Khelifa Ahmed. I am originally from Ethiopia. 
        I grew up in Addis Ababa, which is the capital city of Ethiopia. 
        As a kid, I enjoyed playing soccer on streets on which a vehicle travels on. 
        It was always fun when all the neighborhood kids gather and play together. 
        It left me a great memory of childhood. I grew up with a family of eight. 
        I have brothers and sisters in Ethiopia.

    <p>
        I also have some brothers and sisters in the United States of America.
         I have been living with my family in Maryland for a couple of years. 
         I studied Biology at Morgan State University in Baltimore, Maryland. 
         I made so many friends at Morgan State University.
